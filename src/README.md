If you wish to run the code locally run the following commands.

```
yarn
yarn start
visit http://localhost:3000
```

You can also run as an electron app by running `yarn run electron-start`.

Please note that the Spotify API only provides 30 second audio snippets. It may be possible to get the full track by using the [Web Playback SDK](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/).

## [Spotify-SDK-Restrictions](https://developer.spotify.com/policy/#iii-some-prohibited-applications)`This SDK must not be used in commercial projects without Spotify's prior written approval`.

So i used spotify API where it provides only login through spotify by that we can get that spotify user data by api communication through the client with the servers.We are restricted for only 30 Seconds playback of songs Due to Spotify webplay SDK restrictions.
